## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

### Built with

- Responsive Layout


### What I learned

I learned a few things from building this. I didn't know how to position a background image. I also didn't know how to lower opacity on font. I'm getting more comfortable with CSS Grid.

```css
    background-color: hsl(263, 55%, 52%);
    color: #fff;
    background-image: url(images/bg-pattern-quotation.svg);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: 80% 0%;
```
```css
box-shadow: 0 30px 60px -12px rgb(50 50 93 / 25%), 0 18px 36px -18px rgb(0 0 0 / 30%), 0 -12px 36px -8px rgb(0 0 0 / 3%);
```



### Continued development

- I want to go and fix the mobile design a little. I made the mistake of not performing Mobile First Design.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.wesbos.com) - This helped me learn CSS Grid. The best part is, the course is free.
